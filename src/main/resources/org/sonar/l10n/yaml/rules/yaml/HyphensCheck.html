<p>Use this rule to control the number of spaces after hyphens (<code>-</code>).</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>max-spaces-after</dt>
    <dd>Defines the maximal number of spaces allowed after hyphens.
        Set to a negative integer if you want to allow any number of spaces.
        Cannot be set to 0.</dd>
    <dt>min-spaces-after</dt>
    <dd>Defines the minimal number of spaces allowed after hyphens.
        Set to a negative integer if you want to allow any number of spaces. When set to a
        positive value, cannot be greater than <code>max-spaces-after</code>.</dd>
    <dt>check-scalars</dt>
    <dd>YAMLLint will consider "-xx" as a scalar. However you may consider that, in your context,
        such a syntax is a typo and is actually a sequence and as a consequence there should be
        a space after the hyphen. As this is not a standard behaviour, you explicitly need to
        enable this control by setting the option <code>check-scalars</code> to <code>true</code>.
        <strong>Use with caution</strong> as all scalars will be checked and non-solvable false
        positive might be identified. Has no effect when set to <code>true</code> but
        <code>min-spaces-after</code> is disabled (&lt; 0).</dd>

<p>Examples</p>
<p>With <code>max-spaces-after = 1</code>
    the following code snippet would <strong>PASS</strong>:</p>

    - first list:
        - a
        - b
    - - 1
      - 2
      - 3
</pre>
<p>the following code snippets would <strong>FAIL</strong>:</p>
<pre>
    -  first list:
         - a
         - b
</pre>

<p>With <code>max-spaces-after = 3</code>
    the following code snippet would <strong>PASS</strong>:</p>
<pre>
    -   key
    -  key2
    - key42
</pre>
<p>the following code snippet would <strong>FAIL</strong>:</p>
<pre>

    -   key2
    -  key42
</pre>

<p>With <code>hyphens: {min-spaces-after: 3}</code>
    the following code snippet would <strong>PASS</strong>:</p>
<pre>
    list:
    -   key
    -    key2
    -     key42
    -foo:  # starter of a new sequence named "-foo"; without the colon, a syntax error will be raised.
</pre>
<p>the following code snippet would <strong>FAIL</strong>:</p>
<pre>
    -  key
    -   key2
    -  key42
</pre>

<p>With <code>hyphens: {min-spaces-after: 3, check-scalars: true}</code>
    the following code snippet would <strong>PASS</strong>:</p>

    list:
    -   key
    -    key2
    -     key42
    key: -value
</pre>
<p>the following code snippet would <strong>FAIL</strong>:</p>
<pre>
    ---
    -item
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
    sequence:
      -key  # Mind the spaces before the hyphen to enforce the sequence and avoid a syntax error
