<p>Use this rule to force the type of new line characters.</p>

<p>Be aware that, for simplicity reasons, only the first line of the YAML file is checked and therefore issues will be
    reported only on this first line. It is assumed that the whole document has the same new line characters as the first
    line, and if your document has different new line sequences this inconsistency will not be reported.</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>type</dt>
    <dd>Set <code>type</code> to <code>unix</code> to enforce UNIX-typed new line characters (<code>\n</code>),
        set <code>type</code> to <code>dos</code> to enforce DOS-typed new line characters (<code>\r\n</code>),
        or set <code>type</code> to <code>platform</code> to infer the type from the system running yamllint
        (<code>\n</code> on POSIX / UNIX / Linux / Mac OS systems or <code>\r\n</code> on DOS / Windows systems).</dd>
