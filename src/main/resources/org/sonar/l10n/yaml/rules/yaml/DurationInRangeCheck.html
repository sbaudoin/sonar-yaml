<p>Use this rule to control that the YAML documents for a specified key, only contain <strong>Duration</strong> values within a specified range.
    The simple format used by Spring boots' DurationStyle is used to parse the String and convert into a value in milliseconds. Options are: ns, us, ms, s, m, h, d.
    The range can be defined with a minimum and a maximum milliseconds value. The specific key can be defined with a regular expression
    and the location of the key can be defined with two ancestor regular expressions.
</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl>
    <dt>key-name</dt>
    <dd>Regular expression that matches keys for which the duration value must be in range. In order to match any key, set it to
    <code>.*</code>. The start and end line markers <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> are implicit: this means that
    setting <code>foo</code> is equivalent to <code>^foo$</code>.</dd>
    <dt>included-ancestors</dt>
    <dd>Regular expression that matches against an ancestor string made of joining the parent chain of the matching key.
        The parents are separated by a colon (<code>:</code>) and always start with an implicit <code>&lt;root&gt;</code> parent.
        So, the ancestor string for a connectionTimeout key could be: <code>&lt;root&gt;:resilience4j:circuitbreaker.*</code>.
        If the includedAncestors regex matches the ancestor string of the key, the value is range checked.
        The start and end line markers <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> are implicit, just like the key regex.
        Leave empty for no ancestor matching.</dd>
    <dt>excluded-ancestors</dt>
    <dd>Regular expression that matches against the ancestor string of the matching key, just like above.
        However, if this regex matches, the value is *not* range checked.
        The start and end line markers <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> are implicit, just like the key regex.
        Leave empty for no ancestor matching.</dd>
    <dt>minMillis</dt>
    <dd>Integer defining the minimum allowed value in milliseconds.</dd>
    <dt>maxMillis</dt>
    <dd>Integer defining the maximum allowed value in milliseconds.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Examples</h2>


<p>With:</p>
<pre>
    key-name = waitDurationInOpenState|maxWaitDurationInHalfOpenState
    included-ancestors = &lt;root&gt;:resilience4j:circuitbreaker.*
    excluded-ancestors =
    minMillis = 2000
    maxMillis = 60000
</pre>
<p>the following code snippet would <strong>PASS</strong>:</p>
<pre>
resilience4j:
  circuitbreaker:
    instances:
      CosmosDbClientGood:
        waitDurationInOpenState: 50s
        maxWaitDurationInHalfOpenState: 10s
</pre>
<p>the following code snippet would <strong>FAIL</strong>:</p>
<pre>
  resilience4j:
  circuitbreaker:
    instances:
      CosmosDbClientBad:
        waitDurationInOpenState: 1s # violation
        maxWaitDurationInHalfOpenState: 5m # violation
</pre>


Current limitation: yaml list notation is not supported by ancestor matching.
