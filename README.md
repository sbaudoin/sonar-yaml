SonarQube plugin to analyze YAML code based on [yamllint](https://github.com/sbaudoin/yamllint).

## Rules

The plugin comes with a default "Sonar way" profile with most common rules enabled:

* Syntax error check
* Braces check
* Brackets check
* Colons check
* Commas check
* Comments check
* Comments indentation check
* Document start check
* Empty lines check
* Empty values check
* Hyphens check
* Indentation check
* Key duplicates check
* Line length check
* New line at end of file check
* New lines check
* Octal values check
* Trailing spaces check
* Truthy check

Some additional rules are provided but not enabled by default:

* Document end check
* Forbidden key check
* Forbidden value check (new in 1.3.0)
* Key ordering check

Once installed, you may go to the profile management screens to create your own profile and add or remove rules, change levels, and parameters, etc.

## Installation

Plugin for SonarQube 6.6+

Just [download the plugin JAR file](https://github.com/sbaudoin/sonar-yaml/releases) and copy it to the `extensions/plugins` directory of SonarQube and restart.

## Troubleshooting/known issues

### Scan fail with "ERROR: Caused by: _x_ is not a valid line offset for pointer. File _xyz.yml_ has _y_ character(s) at line _z_"

This may be due to [issue #6](https://github.com/sbaudoin/sonar-yaml/issues/6): if your YAML file contains YAML-valid UTF-8 line break characters such as U+2028, SonarQube
may just strip them, causing the character and lines references being different between the YAML parser and SonarQube.

If such an error is met, go to the main or project general settings of the YAML plugin and enable the option "Filter UTF-8 Line Breaks".
This will make the plugin to ignore some valid UTF-8 line break characters (U+2028, U+2029 and U+0085) so that SonarQube and the plugin
both use the same character and line indices and the scan should complete.
